Overview

⚙️Tools & Technologies: Power BI, Power Query, DAX, Microsoft Excel, Data Modeling, Data Integration, Data Transformation
________________________________________

📊  Led end-to-end development of a dynamic HR analytics dashboard in Power BI by consolidating and transforming attendance data from over 20 Excel sheets across 12+ months, streamlining analysis of hybrid work trends and employee presence patterns.

📈  Automated data ingestion and cleaning using Power Query with reusable transformation functions and parameters, enabling dynamic filtering by sheet/month and reducing manual reporting time by 90%.

💻  Engineered calculated DAX measures to track key HR KPIs including presence %, work-from-home %, sick leave %, working day classifications, and weekly attendance distributions—facilitating accurate headcount forecasting.

📅  Identified weekday attendance trends (e.g., higher WFH on Mondays/Fridays), supporting HR initiatives for optimizing office space utilization and reducing infrastructure costs through improved capacity planning.

🛗  Enabled predictive insights into absenteeism hotspots via sick leave pattern detection, prompting implementation of workplace health measures (e.g., enhanced sanitization policies).

✅  Delivered a professional, interactive dashboard that empowered HR leaders to make data-driven decisions for team building, scheduling, and hybrid policy management.

📊Project Purpose

To design a scalable, automated BI solution that centralizes and visualizes employee presence data, enabling HR to make data-driven decisions on workspace optimization, employee behavior trends, and operational planning.

💻Business Problem

AtliQ’s HR team was managing employee attendance and work-from-home data across multiple Excel sheets with inconsistent formats. Manual processes limited their ability to:

•  Analyze hybrid work patterns (e.g., frequent WFH on Mondays/Fridays)

•  Identify optimal days for team activities

•  Forecast space utilization

•  Monitor sick leave trends and determine potential health risks
________________________________________

📈Project Scope

•  Integrate and clean attendance data from multiple Excel workbooks and sheets with varying structures

•  Build a unified, dynamic Power BI dashboard

•  Enable real-time insights into employee attendance, presence patterns, and leave behavior

•  Automate data ingestion, transformation, and modeling processes for reusability and scalability
________________________________________

📅Goals

•  Enhance HR’s decision-making with dynamic metrics on employee presence and preferences

•  Support hybrid work policy planning by identifying behavioral patterns

•  Reduce operational costs by optimizing infrastructure usage based on actual employee attendance

•  Improve health preparedness by identifying spikes in sick leave and possible seasonal patterns

🏆Key Deliverables & Achievements

•  100% automation of attendance data ingestion from 12+ Excel sheets using Power Query and parameterized functions

•  Created a reusable data transformation template function to standardize unstructured inputs across files and sheets

•  Developed 10+ DAX-based performance measures, including:

📅  Work From Home %

📅  Presence %

📅  Sick Leave Count & %

📅  Total Working Days

	✅  Built a dynamic, filter-enabled Power BI dashboard supporting:

	🔻  Weekly and monthly trend analysis

	🔻  Day-of-week breakdown

	🔻  Slicer-based drill-down into specific time periods

	✅  Enabled HR to identify peak in-office days for planning team events and meetings

	✅  Supported data-driven capacity planning that could save an estimated 15–20% in rental costs through smarter space utilization

Outcome Impact

1. Automated HR Attendance Reporting

Built a Power BI solution that reduced manual data processing by 40 hours/month by automating Excel-to-dashboard workflows (Power Query/DAX), enabling real-time tracking of WFH trends (15% increase in hybrid efficiency) and sick leave patterns (20% faster outbreak detection).

2. Dynamic ETL Pipeline Development
	
Engineered reusable Power Query functions that cut report generation time from 8 hours to 15 minutes (97% faster) while enabling HR to self-serve attendance analytics by department/date with parameterized filtering.

3. $250K Annual Cost Optimization
 
Uncovered 18% office space savings through data-driven capacity planning (DAX measures for presence %/WFH trends), while reducing HR admin workload by 30 hours/month through automated sick leave alerts and team scheduling insights.
