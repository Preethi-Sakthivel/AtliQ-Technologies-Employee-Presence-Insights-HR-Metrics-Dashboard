HR Analytics Automation Dashboard 

Organization: AtliQ Technologies

Overview

⚙️Tools & Technologies: Power BI, Power Query, DAX, Microsoft Excel, Data Modeling, Data Integration, Data Transformation
________________________________________

📊Led end-to-end development of a dynamic HR analytics dashboard in Power BI by consolidating and transforming attendance data from over 20 Excel sheets across 12+ months, streamlining analysis of hybrid work trends and employee presence patterns.

📈Automated data ingestion and cleaning using Power Query with reusable transformation functions and parameters, enabling dynamic filtering by sheet/month and reducing manual reporting time by 90%.

💻Engineered calculated DAX measures to track key HR KPIs including presence %, work-from-home %, sick leave %, working day classifications, and weekly attendance distributions—facilitating accurate headcount forecasting.

📅Identified weekday attendance trends (e.g., higher WFH on Mondays/Fridays), supporting HR initiatives for optimizing office space utilization and reducing infrastructure costs through improved capacity planning.

🛗Enabled predictive insights into absenteeism hotspots via sick leave pattern detection, prompting implementation of workplace health measures (e.g., enhanced sanitization policies).

✅Delivered a professional, interactive dashboard that empowered HR leaders to make data-driven decisions for team building, scheduling, and hybrid policy management.

💻Business Problem

AtliQ’s HR team was managing employee attendance and work-from-home data across multiple Excel sheets with inconsistent formats. Manual processes limited their ability to:

•	Analyze hybrid work patterns (e.g., frequent WFH on Mondays/Fridays)

•	Identify optimal days for team activities

•	Forecast space utilization

•	Monitor sick leave trends and determine potential health risks
________________________________________

📈Project Scope

•	Integrate and clean attendance data from multiple Excel workbooks and sheets with varying structures

•	Build a unified, dynamic Power BI dashboard

•	Enable real-time insights into employee attendance, presence patterns, and leave behavior

•	Automate data ingestion, transformation, and modeling processes for reusability and scalability
________________________________________

📅Goals

•	Enhance HR’s decision-making with dynamic metrics on employee presence and preferences

•	Support hybrid work policy planning by identifying behavioral patterns

•	Reduce operational costs by optimizing infrastructure usage based on actual employee attendance

•	Improve health preparedness by identifying spikes in sick leave and possible seasonal patterns
