💻Business Problem

AtliQ’s HR team was managing employee attendance and work-from-home data across multiple Excel sheets with inconsistent formats. Manual processes limited their ability to:

•	Analyze hybrid work patterns (e.g., frequent WFH on Mondays/Fridays)

•	Identify optimal days for team activities

•	Forecast space utilization

•	Monitor sick leave trends and determine potential health risks

📈Project Scope

•	Integrate and clean attendance data from multiple Excel workbooks and sheets with varying structures

•	Build a unified, dynamic Power BI dashboard

•	Enable real-time insights into employee attendance, presence patterns, and leave behavior

•	Automate data ingestion, transformation, and modeling processes for reusability and scalability

📅Goals

•	Enhance HR’s decision-making with dynamic metrics on employee presence and preferences

•	Support hybrid work policy planning by identifying behavioral patterns

•	Reduce operational costs by optimizing infrastructure usage based on actual employee attendance

•	Improve health preparedness by identifying spikes in sick leave and possible seasonal patterns
